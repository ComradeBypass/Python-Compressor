# File Size Compressor (Python)
A 100% Python Compressor that uses zlib!


## Documentation

- This Compressor makes your file size WAY SMALLER (if your file is 50kb - it would be like 20kb after compression!)
- Its really effective when your file size is too large, or you have lots of repetetive code!

- You need to put your file in the same directory as the compressor file and open the compressor file, it will ask you for a file location, so for example: if my file was named "test" I would type test.py. After you type it, press enter. The Compressor will start to compress the file, it will create a completely new python file in the same directory that will be compressed.

## Requirements
- All the packages that are needed are already pre-installed in python.
- Its zlib, codecs
